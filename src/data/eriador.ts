The battle at Fornost was fierce and bitter, and left many of
the Dúnedain wounded. The sight of the wraiths had very
nearly broken their spirit, and had it not been for the valiant
efforts of Iârion’s companions, the Rangers would not have
withstood the attack. Once dawn had finally arrived, the
Dúnedain recuperated their strength, shoring up the defenses of
Deadmen’s Dike and tending to the wounded.
Amarthiúl had other concerns. Iârion had been captured during
the battle by the Wraith Thaurdir, and there was still time to
come to his aid. The heroes who had helped defend Fornost
vowed to rescue Iârion as well, and so their hunt began. It
didn’t take long for them to find the enemy’s tracks leading
northeast into the hills.
Thaurdir and the remnants of his forces, including the minions
that subdued and captured Iârion, were making great haste
across the North Downs. Despite the enemy’s efforts to get
away, the heroes were smaller in number and eager to pursue
their quarry. Iârion’s captors took little care to cover their
tracks, and so the hunters spent many hours chasing afoot
without stopping to rest, eat or find their bearings. They
traveled far into the night, hoping to overtake Thaurdir under
the cover of darkness. But when the sun rose over the green
hills, they had still closed little ground on their adversary.
Amarthiúl looked north to the horizon and sighed, worry etched
upon his brow. “It’s no use. Thaurdir is a Wraith of the shadow
world, and his minions care not for food or rest. They travel
unhindered for weeks without feeling weariness, while we
struggle to keep pace.” He turned to his companions, forlorn.
“Patience, my friend,” one of the heroes said, clasping
Amarthiúl’s shoulder. “Whether it be at sunset tonight or a
fortnight from now, we will not stop pursuing them until we
have rescued Iârion. They must have some need of him alive,
for we have seen no sign that harm has befallen him.”
“Indeed, although that thought worries me equally,” another of their company said. “Amarthiúl, what do you know of Iârion?
What reason would Thaurdir have to take him captive? Surely
Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain, would have been a
greater prize.”
The young Ranger took Iârion’s pendant from one of the
pouches he wore across his belt and stared at it remorsefully.
“I... I am not sure,” he said, shaking his head. “Iârion comes
from a noble bloodline, that I do know. This is the symbol of his
house,” he explained, showing the heroes the pendant of the
hawk-in-flight they’d seen Iârion wearing. “A lesser prize than
Aragorn you say, and no doubt that is true. But Aragorn’s true 
heritage we have long kept hidden from the Enemy. Iârion’s
heritage needed no such safekeeping. As long as I’ve known
him, he has worn this pendant proudly.” The Ranger’s eyes
narrowed and he looked at the heroes with bitter vengeance
deep in his thoughts. “Whatever the reason, I know what I saw
at Fornost. Thaurdir could have taken many others, but left
them dead or wounded instead. When Iârion challenged him,
he sent his minions one at a time, sacrificing them to Iârion’s
blade in order to wear him down. He meant to capture Iârion
alive. Perhaps that was his goal all along.” The rest of the
company nodded in response to Amarthiúl, whose logic
seemed sound.
“All the more reason why we must pace ourselves,” one of the heroes said. “We are no help to Iârion falling over with
exhaustion. We must be ready to fight when we reach the
Wraith. Let us press on!”
They continued to track their quarry for many miles, keeping
a more sustainable pace, resting briefly when necessary and
pressing onward with haste when the enemy’s tracks led them
downhill or through level country. Eventually they reached the
edge of the North Downs, where the green hills gave way to the
vast and desolate lands of northern Eriador. The weather grew
colder and fouler the further north they traveled. Snow and
freezing rain began to pelt their cloaks and hoods, and for the
first time since departing Fornost, they felt the need to camp for
the night.
That was the first night they heard the howling. It came from all
around them, growing louder with each passing minute. One of the heroes took charge and alerted the rest of the company.
“We cannot tarry. The wolves here are evil and vicious, and
the darkness of night is their hunting ground.” They quickly
broke camp, the weight of weariness beginning to take its toll.
Throughout the night, the incessant baying of wolves was ever
at their heels. Amarthiúl gave voice to their common concern:
“I fear our hunt has just become theirs…”
